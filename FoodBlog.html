      Pierogi are a famous Polish cuisine that I love.
    My mom and I spent hours together making dough, preparing filling, and stuffing the dough the delicious filling.
      ood is a big deal in my family, and knowing that by cooking Polish cuisine I am keeping the family tradition going means a lot to me. </li>
      I have reviewed dozens and dozens of different foods, and now for my favorite food, pierogi.

<h3>Time to Review! </h3>
<li>Pierogi are often compared to dumplings, they are dough filled delicacies that are very popular in Poland. </li>
<li>To make them, you prepare dough and wrap it around an assortment of fillings, such as fruit, meat, and potatoes. </li>
<li>They are a bit too big to be called bite size, but they are around a similar size as a dumpling. </li>
<li>Pierogi take a while to make, but when you have the entire family helping out they become more manageable! </li>
